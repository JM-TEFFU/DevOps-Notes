# KUBERNETES

Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It offers a robust, flexible environment to manage container workloads, enabling organizations to deploy applications efficiently at scale.

# Key Concepts

# Containers
Containers package applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistent, reproducible deployments across multiple environments.

# Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster comprises a set of nodes that host containerized applications, serving as the underlying infrastructure for your deployments.

# Pods
Pods, the smallest unit in Kubernetes, encapsulate one or more containers. They share the same network namespace and storage, and serve as the building blocks of your application.

# Services
Services provide a stable network interface for accessing a group of pods, enabling load balancing and service discovery within the cluster.

# Replication Controllers & Replica Sets
Replication Controllers and Replica Sets ensure a defined number of pod replicas run continuously, maintaining the application's desired state.

# Deployments
Deployments manage application updates and rollbacks, offering a higher-level abstraction for seamless change management.

# ConfigMaps & Secrets
ConfigMaps and Secrets externalize configuration and sensitive data, allowing environment-specific settings without altering the container images.

# Volumes
Volumes provide persistent storage for pods, enabling data to persist beyond the pod’s lifecycle and facilitating data sharing between containers.

# Kubernetes Architecture
Kubernetes operates on a master-worker architecture. The Master Node manages the control plane, which consists of:

1. **API Server:** The core interface that handles requests to create, update, and delete Kubernetes objects like pods and services.
2. **Scheduler:** Responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
3. **Controller Manager:** A collection of controllers that maintain the desired state of the cluster.
4. **etcd:** A distributed key-value store that acts as the main datastore for Kubernetes, storing configuration data and metadata reliably.

# Agent Node Components:

1. **Container Runtime:** Manages the lifecycle of containers on the node (supports Docker, containerd, etc.).
2. **Kubelet:** Ensures that the containers are running as specified by the pod manifest.
3. **Kube-proxy:** Manages networking rules, enabling communication and load balancing between services and pods.

# Benefits of Kubernetes

1. **Scalability:** Kubernetes automatically scales applications based on traffic and demand.
2. **High Availability:** Distributes workloads across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability.
3. **Self-Healing:** Automatically replaces failed containers, maintaining your desired state.
4. **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks:** Seamlessly update applications with no downtime while allowing easy rollback if needed.
5. **Service Discovery & Load Balancing:** Facilitates internal communication between pods and external traffic load balancing.

# YAML Files in Kubernetes

YAML files are essential for defining the desired state of Kubernetes objects such as pods, services, and deployments. Below are examples of Deployment and Service YAML files.

# Deployment YAML Example

```shell

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80



```

# Service YAML Example
```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort


```
# Installing Kubernetes (Steps)

# Step 1: On Master and Worker Nodes
```shell

apt-get update -y

apt-get install docker.io -y

service docker restart

curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -

echo "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt install kubeadm=1.20.0-00 kubectl=1.20.0-00 kubelet=1.20.0-00 -y

```

# Step 2: On Master Node

```shell

kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16


```

# Step 3: Configure Kubernetes on Master Node

```shell

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config


```

# Step 4: Install Networking (Calico)

```shell

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.1/manifests/calico.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.49.0/deploy/static/provider/baremetal/deploy.yaml


```

# Essential ```kubectl``` Commands

1. **kubectl get** – Retrieve resources information:

- ```kubectl get pods```
- ```kubectl get deployments```
- ```kubectl get services```
- ```kubectl get nodes```

2. **kubectl describe** – Detailed information about a resource:
   
- ```kubectl describe pod <pod-name>```
- ```kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>```
- ```kubectl describe service <service-name>```

3. **kubectl create** – Create resources:

- ```kubectl create -f <file.yaml>```
- ```kubectl create deployment <deployment-name> --image=<image-name>```

4. **kubectl delete** – Remove resources:

- ```kubectl delete pod <pod-name>```
- ```kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>```
- ```kubectl delete service <service-name>```

5. **kubectl apply** – Apply changes to resources:

- ```kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>```
- ```kubectl apply -f <dir>```
6. **kubectl logs** – View pod logs:```
- ```kubectl logs <pod-name>```

7. **kubectl exec** – Run commands inside a container:

- ```kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- <command>```
8. **kubectl port-forward** – Forward local ports to a pod:

- ```kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port>```

These essential commands and the steps outlined will help you get started with Kubernetes and manage your containerized applications effectively.
