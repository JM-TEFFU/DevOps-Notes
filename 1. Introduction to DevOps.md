# What is DevOps?

![flat-design-devops-illustration_23-2149380377](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97f5446b-cb15-41a2-8e4a-935a7256fda4)


DevOps is a software development methodology that prioritizes automation, continuous delivery, and collaboration to deliver high-quality products to clients in a timely and effective manner. DevOps facilitates smoother communication, quicker time-to-market, and more customer satisfaction by dismantling communication gap between the development and operations teams.

The full application lifecycle—from development to testing, operations, and deployment—can be managed by a team using this method. Code is swiftly and reliably deployed to production through automation and repeatability, demonstrating collaboration between the Development and Operations teams.

In DevOps, every stage of the software development lifecycle—from planning to coding to testing to deployment and monitoring—is highly automated. As a result, the development process is more productive, consistent, and has fewer errors. DevOps encourages a continuous improvement culture as well, incorporating feedback loops into the process to speed up iterations and improve decision-making. Adopting DevOps can help organizations become more agile, reduce expenses, and innovate more quickly.

#### The Origin of DevOps

![DALL·E 2024-10-02 09 34 23 - A visual representation of the origin of DevOps, showing how it evolved from separate development and operations teams  Start by illustrating two sepa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b6104b0-5b70-4cc5-bbee-cf29e15cfd9f)


Midway through the 2000s, companies began to realize they needed a more effective and efficient method of delivering software, which is how DevOps got its start. The conventional method of developing software, in which the departments responsible for development and operations were divided, was becoming excessively slow and difficult. This approach's separated structure made it difficult for people to collaborate and communicate, which resulted in slow feedback cycles, lengthy lead times, and poor product.

A new strategy was required to address these issues, and DevOps was created. DevOps aimed to improve communication, cooperation, and integration by bringing software development and operations together to work together. The main goals were to speed up delivery, cut lead times, and automate manual procedures.

#### Early Adoption and Growth of DevOps

The tech sector, and especially web-based businesses, was among the first to use DevOps. These companies have particular difficulties in delivering software because of things like rapid updates, quick development cycles, and a big user base. They quickly implemented DevOps to improve their software delivery process after realizing its advantages.

Amazon was among the first companies to use DevOps, putting the strategy into practice in the early 2000s. Software delivery lead time decrease and manual process automation were the responsibilities of Amazon's DevOps team. As a result, software quality increased and feedback loops speed up, helping Amazon maintain its competitive edge.

An increasing number of firms began to implement DevOps as its advantages became increasingly evident. DevOps emerged as a crucial differentiator for businesses, and those who adopted it saw faster, better-quality, and less expensive software delivery. The growth of cloud computing, which offered the tools and infrastructure required to enable DevOps processes, also contributed to the acceptance of DevOps.

DevOps began to become more widely accepted in the early 2010s, and its uptake quickened. The growing significance of software in all facets of business, from customer interaction to product development, contributed to the rise of DevOps. The demand for DevOps skills and experience increased as organizations realized they had to implement DevOps to stay competitive.

This article explores how, from a DevOps standpoint, COVID-19, the move to the cloud, and its security consequences are creating a new wave of demands for software development in the near future.

 𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱-𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆

According to a Forrester analysis, the cloud plays a key role in pandemic recovery initiatives by allowing millions of workers to work from home, maintaining global supply networks, and quickly changing business models. The global market for public cloud infrastructure is expected to increase by 35% to $120 billion in 2021, which is around $7 billion more than its initial projections. These estimates were revised after the major cloud providers, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba, provided information about their revenue growth.

Businesses will be switching to cloud-native computing in order to take advantage of advantages including increased productivity, reduced expenses, faster delivery times, and simpler management. Micro-services, containers, and an agile framework based on continuous delivery are used by cloud-native apps, allowing enterprises to create more dependable systems faster. The cloud-native method, which increases the speed and efficiency of application development, is inevitable in the upcoming years due to the competitive nature of business.

It makes sense that cloud-native computing is considered the most recent wave of digital transformation by Accenture. According to the report, "scale, resiliency, and agility—both for the business and developers—that are nearly difficult to accomplish with pre-cloud architectures” are delivered by cloud-native systems.

𝟮. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗼𝗽𝘀

More than ever, security controls the next wave of DevOps innovations. The pandemic-induced huge cloud migration requires a stronger focus on cloud-based cybersecurity because security issues have increased. The worldwide crisis has taught us a number of things, one of which is how difficult cloud cybersecurity is for remote workers. Because of this, researchers speculate that the cyber pandemic may come next.

Security and DevOps go hand in hand; if security is included sooner in the application development process, teams may create more secure applications. DevOps makes certain that nothing is left to chance through continuous testing and delivery. "Appreciating security throughout the software delivery lifecycle leads to faster software delivery with fewer security issues," the Puppet State of DevOps report alleges.

However, the focus here is on what businesses are really doing, not just what they ought to do. GitLab's DevSecOps Landscape report 2020 states that 28% of respondents to the study reported being a member of a cross-functional security team, indicating that the responsibilities of security professionals are evolving. Furthermore, 27% of respondents said they would like to participate in regular development activities more. What's possibly more significant is that, according to 65% of these security experts, security is moving left and entering development sooner. Security testing usually happens later because there aren't as many problems at the beginning. We are, however, seeing a shift in the patterns. The final and next point discusses this.

𝟯. 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝗳𝘁

Security is not the only thing moving left; in the upcoming years, testing as a whole will also move heavily farther left. Early-stage defects are less common, which makes it easier for developers to find and address them. When vulnerabilities are found in production, they can cost up to $7600 to fix, yet in early development, the same vulnerabilities can be corrected for as little as $80-$85. Shift-left testing is therefore necessary. The increasing tendency shows that developers are reacting accordingly.

One of the effects of shifting left is that traditional testing teams are being robbed of testing privilege. Capgemini's Continuous Testing Report 2020 supports this. The paper mentions Model-based Testing (MBT), Test-driven Development (TDD), and predictive analytics/machine learning as the key frameworks behind the growing acceptance of shift left.

There are many benefits to shifting to the left, such as improved productivity and teamwork among employees. It also makes it possible to create apps that are compliant and safe in larger contexts. After all, a cloud service's security in isolation is one thing, but its security when combined with other industrial tools is quite another.

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: 2021 is already looking like a good year, even though there doesn't seem to be an end in view for the growing pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 on business and development will certainly be long-term, and the work, operations, and development of the future will largely depend on the trends that take center stage in the coming year. Thus far, we have discovered that:


Many more cloud-native apps will be released.


Testing will become more common much earlier in the development life cycle, and security will be a bigger DevOps priority.

# Why DevOps?

The goal of DevOps is to increase an organization’s speed when it comes to delivering applications and services.

# What Distinguishes Traditional IT From DevOps? 

Traditional IT is built by many teams using different standards and contains thousands of lines of code; in comparison, DevOps is created by a single team with deep product understanding. Understanding traditional IT might be difficult, however DevOps is simple.

# Responsibilities

# How DevOps Works?

The DevOps Lifecycle divides the SDLC lifecycle into the following stages:

![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6a10a39-2bc0-4be8-becc-7e67cc96950b)

![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e92061a7-42fe-47bf-9137-b3fdb62a5513)


# 1. Continuous Development: 

Continuous Development is important for DevOps because it increases productivity each time a piece of code is developed, tested, built, and put into production. Code is written in small, continuous pieces rather than all at once. Continuous Development improves the code's quality and speeds up the process of fixing errors, vulnerabilities, and faults. It makes it easier for developers to focus on writing excellent code.

![Code-developing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/086c7d6f-2167-4c0a-92b9-bfd095163024)


# 2. Continuous Integration:

In DevOps, there are four primary stages that describe continuous integration. They are listed in the following order:

1. Obtaining SourceCode using SCM
2. Constructing the code 
3. Code quality assessment
4. The building of artifacts' storage

The Continuous Integration flow consists of the stages listed above. We can use any tool that best fits our needs at each stage, and one of the most widely used tools is GitHub for source code management (SCM). As a developer writes code on his local computer, he pushes it to GitHub, a remote repository from which anyone with access can pull, clone, and edit the code as needed.From there, we can test the Junit scenarios and build them into the necessary package (war, jar, and ear) using Maven.When SonarQube does code quality reviews, it evaluates the source code's quality and produces a report in HTML or PDF format. Jenkins, a continuous integration tool, is used throughout the process to create the build artifacts, and Nexus will assist us in storing the artifacts created with Maven.

# 3. Continuous Testing:

Continuous testing can be implemented by any organization using the agile and DevOps approaches. Testsigma, Selenium, LambdaTest, and other automation testing tools can be used for continuous testing, depending on our needs. These technologies allow us to test our code quicker and intelligently, as well as prevent issues and code smells. An additional advantage is that the entire process may be automated with the help of a continuous integration platform like Jenkins.

# 4. Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery

The technique of automatically delivering an application into the production environment when it has finished the build and testing phases is known as continuous deployment. Everything from getting the source code of the application to deploying it will be automated in this case.

![continuous-delivery-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db6c33f5-6b26-401a-aaab-07bda69b9326)

# Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery refers to the process of manually deploying an application into production servers when it has finished the construction and testing phases. Although the continuous integration processes      will now be automated, manual intervention is still necessary to deploy it to the production environment.

# 5. Continuous Monitoring: 

If continuous monitoring is excluded from the DevOps lifecycle, it is incomplete. Prometheus and Grafana enable continuous monitoring, allowing us to keep an eye on things and receive alerts before they get out of hand. We may collect a wide range of performance metrics with Prometheus' assistance, such as error rates, network traffic, CPU and memory usage, and application response times. Data from time series, such as CPU and memory consumption, can be visually represented and tracked with Grafana.

# 6. Continuous Feedback

After the program is made available to the public, end users will utilize it and, after providing us with several feedbacks, will let us know how well it performs and if there are any bugs that negatively impact the user experience. In order to reduce errors or bugs in the code we are currently developing and to produce much more effective results for end users, the DevOps team will analyze the feedback provided by end users and then reach out to the development team to try and rectify any mistakes they may have made. Additionally, we will eliminate any needless steps involved in deploying the application. Constant Feedback can improve the application's functionality and lower the number of bugs in the code making it smooth for end users to use the application.

# 7. Continuous Operation:

By introducing continuous operation, we will be able to maintain the better application uptime while reducing maintenance downtime that could negatively affect end users' experiences. Continuous operations lead to improved quality control, reduced production costs, and increased productivity.

# Different Phases of the DevOps Lifecycle

1. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻: During this stage, experts assess the commercial requirement and obtain feedback from end users. They create a project strategy in this step in order to maximize business effect and achieve the desired outcome.
2. 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲: At this stage, the code is being written. The development team uses lifecycle DevOps tools and extensions like Git to simplify the design process and help them avoid bad coding standards and safety issues.
3. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱: After finishing their work, programmers submit their code to the common code source using technologies like Maven and Gradle.
4. 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁: The product is initially sent to the test platform to carry out several kinds of screening, like user acceptability testing, safety testing, integration checking, speed testing, and so on, using tools like JUnit, Selenium, etc. in order to ensure software integrity.
5. 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲: At this stage, the build is ready to be implemented in the real world. When the build passes all organizational requirements-based checks and is ready for production, the DevOps team prepares updates or deploys multiple versions.
6. 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆: At this point, Infrastructure-as-Code supports in building the operational infrastructure and then releases the build utilizing various DevOps lifecycle tools.
7. 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲:: Users can now use this version easily. At this point, server configuration and deployment are handled by the management department using technologies like Ansible.
8. 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿: At this stage, the DevOps workflow is examined based on information obtained from many sources, including consumer behavior and application efficiency. Teams can find obstacles impacting the performance of the production and operations teams by having the ability to look at the entire setting.
