![depcheck](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02ac79d-84c0-4b20-90dc-b8a057432eae)

# Overview
OWASP Dependency Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that helps identify known vulnerabilities in your project dependencies. By integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline, you can proactively manage security risks associated with third-party libraries and components.

This guide demonstrates how to set up OWASP Dependency Check in Jenkins and provides a sample Jenkins Pipeline configuration to automate vulnerability scanning.


# Setting up OWASP Dependency Check in Jenkins

Follow these steps to install and configure OWASP Dependency Check in Jenkins:

1. **Access Jenkins:** Open Jenkins and navigate to the Jenkins home page.
2. **Manage Jenkins:** In the left-hand sidebar, click on **Manage Jenkins.**
3. **Install Plugin:** Select **Manage Plugins.** Under the **Available tab**, search for the "OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin." Select the plugin and click **Install without restart.**
3. **Configure Job:** After installation, create a new Jenkins job by clicking **New Item**. Name the job and choose between a Freestyle project or a Pipeline.
4. **Build Step:** Scroll down to the **Build** section of your job configuration, click **Add build step**, and select **Invoke OWASP Dependency-Check.**
5. **Customize Settings:** Configure the Dependency Check plugin as needed (e.g., specify the project path and additional arguments).
6. **Global Tool Configuration:** Ensure you’ve set up the OWASP Dependency-Check tool in Jenkins under **Manage Jenkins** > **Global Tool Configuration.**

Once the setup is complete, OWASP Dependency Check will automatically analyze your project's dependencies during the build process.

# Standalone Installation Option

You can also use OWASP Dependency Check as a standalone tool by downloading the JAR file.

# Steps to Download the Standalone JAR:

1. Visit the OWASP Dependency Check releases page.
2. Download the latest version of the standalone JAR (dependency-check.jar).
3. Ensure you have Java 8 or higher installed.
4. Run the following command:
```shell
java -jar dependency-check.jar --project <project-name> --scan <path-to-project>
```

# Integration with Maven
You can integrate OWASP Dependency Check with Maven for automated vulnerability checks during your builds. Add the following configuration to your pom.xml:

```shell

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
      <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
      <version>INSERT_VERSION_HERE</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>



```

To run the check:

```shell

mvn dependency-check:check

```

# Reporting
OWASP Dependency Check generates detailed reports highlighting the vulnerabilities found in your dependencies. After running the tool, you can access the reports in the following directories:

- **Standalone JAR:** <path-to-project>/target/dependency-check-report.html
- **Maven:** <path-to-project>/target/dependency-check-report.html
- **Gradle:** <path-to-project>/build/reports/dependency-check-report.html

# Jenkins Pipeline with OWASP Dependency Check
Below is a sample Jenkins Pipeline configuration that incorporates OWASP Dependency Check along with other build steps such as SonarQube analysis and deployment:

```shell
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        jdk 'jdk17'
        maven 'maven3'
    }

    stages {
        stage('SCM Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Checking out from SCM...'
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/JM-TEFFU/Petclinic.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Compile') {
            steps {
                echo 'Compiling the project...'
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            environment {
                SCANNER_HOME = tool 'sonar-scanner'
            }
            steps {
                withSonarQubeEnv('sonar-server') {
                    sh '''$SCANNER_HOME/bin/sonar-scanner \
                         -Dsonar.projectName=Petclinic \
                         -Dsonar.java.binaries=. \
                         -Dsonar.projectKey=Petclinic'''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('OWASP Dependency Check') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running OWASP Dependency Check...'
                dependencyCheck additionalArguments: '--scan target/', odcInstallation: 'dp-check'
            }
        }

        stage('Publish OWASP Dependency Check Report') {
            steps {
                publishHTML(target: [
                    allowMissing: false,
                    alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                    keepAll: true,
                    reportDir: 'target',
                    reportFiles: 'dependency-check-report.html',
                    reportName: 'OWASP Dependency Check Report'
                ])
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                sh 'cp target/petclinic.war /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/webapps'
            }
        }
    }
}
