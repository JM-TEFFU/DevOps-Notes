# ðŸš€ What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java, designed to streamline software development by automating tasks such as building, testing, and deploying applications. It is widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) processes, making it a key tool for modern DevOps practices. Jenkins stands out for its extensive plugin ecosystem, ease of configuration, and the fact that it is free to use.

# Key Features of Jenkins

1. **Continuous Integration:** Automatically builds and tests your code with each commit, providing rapid feedback and minimizing integration issues.
2. **Continuous Delivery:** Automates deployment to different environments, ensuring a smoother and faster release cycle.
3. **Extensibility:** With over 1,500 plugins, Jenkins integrates seamlessly with a wide range of tools, including version control (Git), build tools (Maven), and cloud platforms.

# Why Jenkins Matters
Jenkins empowers teams to deliver software faster and more reliably. It reduces bottlenecks in development and fosters better collaboration across teams, driving efficiency throughout the software development lifecycle.

# Real-World Application of Jenkins
Letâ€™s look at how Jenkins can be integrated into a typical development workflow:

1. **Version Control:** Developers commit changes to a repository like Git.
2. **Automated Build:** Jenkins detects code changes and triggers the build process.
3. **Automated Testing:** After building, Jenkins runs automated tests, such as unit, integration, and functional tests.
4. **Code Quality Analysis:** Jenkins integrates with tools like SonarQube to assess code quality and generate reports.
5. **Artifact Storage:** Build artifacts are archived for later use.
6. **Deployment:** Jenkins automates deployment to environments like staging or production.
7. **Notification and Reporting:** Jenkins sends updates on build status and results, providing transparency and accountability.
8. **Continuous Deployment:** Code can be automatically deployed to production based on predefined conditions.
9. **Monitoring and Scaling:** Integrates with monitoring tools to ensure applications perform well post-deployment.
10. **Scheduled Jobs:** Automates recurring tasks like backups or maintenance.

# Installing Jenkins on AWS EC2 Instance

# Prerequisites:
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

# Method 1: Install Jenkins on Linux

```shell

sudo apt update -y

sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre -y

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

sudo systemctl enable jenkins

sudo systemctl start jenkins

sudo systemctl status jenkins


```

# Method 2: Install Jenkins with WAR File

```shell

sudo apt update -y

sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre -y

wget https://updates.jenkins.io/download/war/2.387.3/jenkins.war

java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8082

Note: Open the necessary port in AWS Security Group (e.g., port 8080 for Jenkins).

```

# Setting Up Jenkins

After installation, follow these steps to configure Jenkins:

1. Access Jenkins via the EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP: http://<instance_public_ip>:8080.
2. Retrieve the admin password:
```shell
  sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
3. Complete the setup wizard by installing the recommended plugins.
4. Optionally, create the first admin user for future configurations.

# Configuring Jenkins for Optimal Use

# Plugin Installation

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins.**
2. Select desired plugins from the **Available** tab and install them.
3. Restart Jenkins if necessary.

# Global Tool Configuration

- Configure tools like JDK, Git, and Maven under Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration.

# System Configuration

- Configure system-wide settings such as Jenkins URL, email notifications, and security settings under **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System.**

# Adding Credentials

- Manage credentials under **Manage Jenkins** > **Credentials** to securely store and access sensitive information like API keys and passwords.

# Docker Integration with Jenkins

1. Install Docker:
```shell

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io

```
2. Grant permissions to the Jenkins user:
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart docker

```

# Jenkins Job Types

# Freestyle Job

1. Go to **New Item** > **Freestyle Project.**
2. Configure source code management (Git), build steps (Maven), and deployment (to Tomcat) under **Build.**

# Pipeline Job
1. Go to **New Item** > **Pipeline.**
2. Define stages for Git checkout, Maven build, and Tomcat deployment in the pipeline script.
```shell

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'your-repo-url'
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'cp target/yourapp.war /path/to/tomcat/webapps/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
# Multibranch Pipeline

- Configure a **Multibranch Pipeline** job to handle multiple branches in your repository, automating builds across all branches.
