# Real-World Scenario: Developing and Deploying a Web Application with Docker

This document outlines a practical approach for a development team working on a web application composed of multiple microservices, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the development, testing, and deployment phases across various environments.

# 1. Development Environment

- Each developer establishes their local environment using Docker, leveraging **Docker Compose** to define the necessary services, including web servers, databases, caches, and more.
- Docker containers create consistent and isolated environments, allowing developers to share Docker Compose configurations effortlessly, ensuring uniform setup across the team.
  
# 2. Continuous Integration (CI)

- The team implements a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes. Docker facilitates the creation of reproducible build environments in the CI workflow.
- The CI system builds Docker images based on the application code using a Dockerfile.
- Images are tagged with unique identifiers, such as commit hashes or build numbers, for easy tracking.
  
# 3. Testing Environment

- Docker simplifies the setup and teardown of testing environments. The CI system can launch Docker containers from built images to execute automated tests.
- Separate Docker Compose configurations allow for distinct testing environments, including staging and integration.
- Quick provisioning of containers enables parallel testing and optimizes resource utilization.
  
# 4. Deployment

- Validated Docker images are pushed to a Docker registry, making them ready for deployment.
- Deployment environments, whether on-premises or in cloud infrastructure, utilize Docker for container management.
- Container orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes ensure effective scaling and high availability.

# Benefits of Using Docker

- **Consistency:** Docker guarantees uniform environments across development, testing, and deployment stages, minimizing environment-related issues.
- **Reproducibility:** Docker fosters the creation of reproducible build environments, ensuring consistent application behavior.
- **Scalability:** The containerization approach allows easy service scaling and efficient resource management.
- **Isolation:** Containers provide process isolation, mitigating conflicts between various services or dependencies.
- **Portability:** Docker containers can be run on multiple platforms and cloud services, facilitating seamless deployment and migration.
  
This example illustrates how Docker can enhance development and deployment workflows, making it a popular choice across diverse applications and infrastructures.

# Docker Commands for Building, Tagging, Pushing, and Running Images

Here are the essential Docker commands for managing your images:

# 1. Build an Image

```shell
docker build -t <image_name> <path_to_dockerfile>

```
This command builds a Docker image from the specified Dockerfile located at <path_to_dockerfile>. The -t option tags the image with a name.

# 2. Tag an Image

```shell
docker tag <image_name> <new_tag>

```

This command assigns a new tag to an existing Docker image. <image_name> refers to the current image, while <new_tag> is the desired new tag.

# 3. Push an Image to a Docker Registry

```shell

docker push <image_name>
```

This command uploads a Docker image to a Docker registry, making it accessible for others. Ensure you log in using ```docker login``` before pushing.

# 4. Run a Docker Image

```shell

docker run <image_name>

```
This command executes a Docker image as a container. You can customize the container’s behavior with additional options, like mapping ports:

```shell
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>

```
For comprehensive details and more advanced options, consult the official Docker documentation.

# Jenkins Declarative Pipeline Script

Here’s an example of a Jenkins declarative pipeline script for building and deploying a Dockerized application:

```shell

pipeline {
    agent any
    
    tools {
        jdk 'jdk11'
        maven 'maven3'
    }
    
    environment {
        SCANNER_HOME = tool 'sonar-scanner'
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Git Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/jaiswaladi246/Shopping-Cart.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Compile') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean compile"
            }
        }
        
        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    $SCANNER_HOME/bin/sonar-scanner \
                    -Dsonar.url=http://13.233.102.184:9000/ \

                '''
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"

                        sh "docker build -t shopping-cart -f docker/Dockerfile ."
                        sh "docker tag shopping-cart adijaiswal/shopping-cart:latest"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    withDockerRegistry(credentialsId: 'c9b058e5-bfe6-41f8-9b5d-dc0b0d2955ac', toolName: 'docker') {
                        sh "docker push adijaiswal/shopping-cart:latest"

                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy To Docker Container') {
